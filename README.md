## Summary

This project creates a web UI around the [CosmWasm/cw-plus](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/) [`cw3-fixed-multisig`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/tree/main/contracts/cw3-fixed-multisig) smart contract. Users can:

- Create an instance of `cw3-fixed-multisig` smart contract
- View proposals for a previously instantiated multisig
- Create proposals for sending funds from the multisig
- Vote on proposals created by other users of the multisig
- Execute proposals that have reached sufficient approval vote threshold

## Proposal List UI

The proposal list UI provides icons indicating proposal status:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/public-awesome/cw3-fixed-multisig-dapp
```

First, setup your `.env` file by copying the example:
